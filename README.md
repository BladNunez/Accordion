# Accordion

In this small project I will be creating an accordion which allows a lot of info to be in a small space. For this I created a FAQ(frequently asked questions). This will display three questions with a dropdown and once that is pressed you can see the question displayed. This project helped me work on my DOM skills and using concepts such as document.getElementByClassName(), addEventListener(), classList.toggle(). Also had the ability to work with some CSS psuedo elements.
