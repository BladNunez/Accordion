# Accordion

In this small project I will be creating an accordion which allows a lot of info to be in a small space. For this I created a FAQ(frequently asked questions). This will display three questions with a dropdown and once that is pressed you can see the question displayed. This project helped me work on my DOM skills and using concepts such as document.getElementByClassName(), addEventListener(), classList.toggle().
